# LED-matrix-patterns
drifting gradients and patterns from Lashley’s The Mechanism of Vision

These patterns are written for Arduino and are designed to be used with an 8x8 Adafruit LED matrix and backpack. See https://github.com/LaubachLab/LED-matrices for design files for the LED matrix stimulus, which is also described in this published article: https://www.eneuro.org/content/8/3/ENEURO.0563-20.2021.

The default is two address select pins: 0x70.

Patterns include several directional drifting gradients as well as patterns from K.S. Lashley’s The Mechanism of Vision.
